            <p>
                Being a travel agency is something that, naturally, comes with a lot of questions. 
                Here are a few of our most commonly asked questions about working with a travel agency. 
                We're here to set your mind at ease, if you don't see your question here, send us 
                an email, we love to talk to you!

            <div class="how">
                <h3 class="ylw">
                    How do travel agencies get paid? will I be charged extra or will my 
                    accommodations have an extra fee?
                </h3>

                <p class="blu">
                    We are paid by the resorts, we do not charge a service fee.  <br><br>

                    Many resorts have price parity, the cost is same whether you book through us, 
                    direct with the resort, or with an online booking engine.  <br><br>

                    The difference between using a travel agent is that we help you plan a 
                    stress-free vacation without the hassle of going it alone.

                    <h3 class="ylw">
                        Why should I book with you instead of an online booking 
                        site, or direct with a resort?
                    </h3>
    
                    <p class="blu">
                        With us, you get exceptional personal assistance before, during, 
                        and after your vacation. <br><br>

                        Budget is important and we strive to get your dream vacation 
                        within the budget you've set for it. There's no pressure to go 
                        above and beyond what you're comfortable with. You can't enjoy 
                        your vacation when you're stressed out about paying for it. <br><br>
                        
                        We provide honest advice about all resorts and destinations 
                        to help you choose the perfect resort for you. <br><br>
                        
                        You also benefit from our extensive personal connections which 
                        carry a certain gravitas when needing anything addressed. We 
                        have an easier time getting you perks (like getting your 
                        room upgraded)—it's easier for us to get a "yes" because we 
                        work with them often. <br><br>
                        
                        We also arm you with your own personal +23408 call number to 
                        call and reach us if you need something while you're away. 
                        You won't get that from a travel site.

                        Will I pay more for vacation if I book through you 
                        than an online booking site?
                    </h3>
    
                    <p class="blu">
                        No. We have access to all the same pricing for resorts as 
                        the online booking sites do and we can price-match online 
                        booking engine pricing when comparing apples to apples. <br><br> 

                        In many cases, we can find discounts and other promotional
                         offerings that are not offered to the general public.
